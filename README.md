# Codebook
To remind me of some algorithms and help people who are starting in competitive programming.
I created this repository with the implementation of some famous algorithms and techniques.
The codes are mostly coded in C/C++ and Python and are divided into the following topics: 
graphs, dynamic programming, dynamic programming, mathematics, string and others.

# 1 - Data Struct
Fenwick Tree
Segment Tree
Segment Tree Lazy Propagation
Square Root Decomposition
Mo's Algorithm

# 2 - DP
Digit DP
Longest Increasing Subsequence
Matriz Exponentiation

# 3 - Graph

# 4 - Math

# 5 - Others
Kadane's Algorithm
Inversion Count Merge Sort
# 6 - String
Hash
KMP
